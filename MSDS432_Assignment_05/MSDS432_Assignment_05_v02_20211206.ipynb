This is an incredibly powerful algorithm. For example, given a list of sorted numbers 1 through 100, the algorithm will begin its search for the select number at the middploint, position 50. If the number at position 50 is higher than the select number, all positions 50 and above have now been eliminated. If the number at position 50 is lower than the select number, all position 50 and below have now been eliminated. Every time, you guess the middle number and eliminate half the remaining numbers.
